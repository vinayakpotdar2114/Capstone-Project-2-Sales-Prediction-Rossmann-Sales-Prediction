# Capstone-Project-2-Sales-Prediction-Rossmann-Sales-Prediction

The dataset we are working here is of a drug
store named Rossman. The dataset is present
in two different tables, each containing a
certain type of information.
The experiment we are performing here is
Sales Prediction using different machine
learning models. We will try to understand
the data using Exploratory Data Analysis
and then start working with the machine
learning models. The major focus will be on
the prediction of Sales of the stores and the
factors affecting the sales.
